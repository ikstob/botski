Botski Produkti
===============

This project is a collection of code to help automate things, these are intended primarily as examples and you may need to build upon them to do something meaningful.  This is a good thing! everyone's requirements may be a little different so rather than trying to solve it all, it makes more sense to make this project very easily customisable.

Getting Started
---------------

If you're not already familiar with Java, it's really quite easy.  In order to get the most out of your keyboard-time I thoroughly recommend you use good tools, namely:

* **Eclipse IDE**
> Download "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

* **Apache Maven**
> Maven handles dependencies for you automatically, downloading all the appropriate libraries.  This used to be a real nightmare for Java projects, Maven takes all this pain away.
>
> Inside **Eclipse** go to Help -> Install New Software -> Select "Juno" from the list -> Browse to "General Purpose Tools" -> Select "m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse" for Installation.

Once you have these installed in your Mac, Windows or Linux machine you are ready to get started.  Open **Eclipse IDE** and it will by default create a directory called `workspace`, open a command-prompt or terminal and navigate to this directory.

Now grab the code:

```
git clone git@github.com:ikstob/botski.git
```

Last but not least, toggle over to Eclipse and go File -> New -> New Java Project -> Choose "Create from existing source" and choose the directory you downloaded the code into.

*DISCLAIMER: This is a basic intro and no substitute to the plethora of tutorials available for Java and Eclipse*
